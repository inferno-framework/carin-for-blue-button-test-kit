##Breaking Change
This release updates the CARIN IG for Blue ButtonÂ® Test Kit to use AuthInfo
rather than OAuthCredentials for storing auth information. As a result of this
change, any test kits which rely on this test kit will need to be updated to use
AuthInfo rather than OAuthCredentials inputs.
